posts this week that looks at the most significant developments of this year in the sectors that we cover, from publishing to mobile to advertising.</em></p>\n\n<p>On the legal front, lawyers made out well (once again) on everything from piracy to patents. Here are six numbers that sum up 2011.\n</p><p><strong>20</strong>: The number of years the Federal Trade Commission will be <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-can-a-twitter-account-be-a-company-trade-secret/\" title=\"auditing\">auditing</a> Facebook and Google (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=GOOG\" title=\"GOOG\">NSDQ: GOOG</a>) over privacy issues. The companies are the biggest trophies yet for America&#8217;s would-be privacy protector which imposed a series of harsher-than-usual measures through consent agreements. The FTC&#8217;s new assertiveness shows the government and the public may finally be paying attention to risks posed by the data industry. This is just the beginning of the privacy debate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>54</strong>: The single-day record for new patent lawsuits. The 54 suits, naming more than 800 defendants, were filed in September by trolls&#8212;shell companies run by lawyers that buy questionable patents and then sue the bejeezus out of companies that actually make things. Meanwhile, patents are also driving a wave of litigation that has engulfed the smartphone industry. This year, however, brought two developments that could mean the patent insanity will abate. The first is the America Invents Act of 2011 which will curb some of the worst excesses of frivolous patent litigation. The second is a federal appeals court&#8217;s decision that make it easier to <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-how-a-texas-dog-park-became-a-new-front-in-americas-patent-wars/\" title=\"transfer cases out of east Texas\">transfer cases out of east Texas</a>, the favorite play-pen of the patent trolls.</p>\n\n<p><strong>$2.50</strong>: The value per month of a Twitter follower according to a <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-new-york-times-sues-huffpo-over-mommy-issues/\" title=\"lawsuit\">lawsuit</a> filed against a writer who took his 17,000 Twitter followers with him when he left his job. These social media suits between publishers and journalists were a new part of the legal landscape in 2011. Another prominent ongoing <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-new-york-times-sues-huffpo-over-mommy-issues/\" title=\"case\">case</a> involves the New York Times (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=NYT\" title=\"NYT\">NYSE: NYT</a>) suing the Huffington Post for poaching its &#8216;Mommylode&#8217; blogger to write a column called &#8216;Parentlode&#8217;</p>\n\n<p><strong>$1 Billion</strong>: The amount Viacom (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=VIA\" title=\"VIA\">NYSE: VIA</a>) says YouTube must pay it for infringing copyright during the early days of the site. The case was thrown out last year but appealed before a federal appeals court in October and a decision is expected any day. <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-all-eyes-on-viacomyoutube-case-after-court-rules-for-veoh/\" title=\"The case\">The case</a> is actually less about money than it is an attempt by content owners to coerce internet sites into a more active role in enforcing copyright.</p>\n\n<p><strong>60</strong>: The approximate number of amendments brought before a House committee in December by opponents of the Stop Online Piracy Act. The <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-new-york-times-sues-huffpo-over-mommy-issues/\" title=\"proposed law\">proposed law</a>, which critics say will &#8216;break the internet,&#8217; has caused the copyright debate to reach a pitch not seen since the Grokster days. Look for this to resume with a bang in January.</p>\n\n<p><strong>27</strong>: The number of class action suits (at last count) filed nationwide against big publishers and Apple (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=AAPL\" title=\"AAPL\">NSDQ: AAPL</a>) over an alleged conspiracy to illegally fix the price of e-books. The cases have just been consolidated before a New York federal judge with arguments set to begin this year. The <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-a-closer-look-at-apples-role-in-the-e-book-conspiracy/\" title=\"lawsuit\">lawsuit</a> will be a marathon not a sprint. Some may wonder, given the pace of change in the publishing industry, if the lawsuit will still be relevant in 2014.</p>\n\n<p><em>Read the rest of the posts in our</em> <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/tag/highlights-of-2011\">Highlights of 2011</a> <em>archives</em>.\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Related</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"related\">\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-highlights-of-2011-the-year-in-advertising-by-the-numbers/\" title=\"Highlights of 2011: The Year In Advertising, By The Numbers\">Highlights of 2011: The Year In Advertising, By The Numbers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-highlights-of-2011-lets-do-the-ceo-shuffle/\" title=\"Highlights Of 2011: Let's Do The CEO Shuffle\">Highlights Of 2011: Let's Do The CEO Shuffle</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-highlights-of-2011-the-year-in-publishing-by-the-numbers/\" title=\"Highlights of 2011: The Year In Book Publishing, By The Numbers\">Highlights of 2011: The Year In Book Publishing, By The Numbers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-highlights-of-2011-a-crazy-year-in-mobile-by-the-numbers/\" title=\"Highlights of 2011: A Crazy Year In Mobile, By The Numbers\">Highlights of 2011: A Crazy Year In Mobile, By The Numbers</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=Bn0BKwp30TqW1LqeHgALinJQOusvFxAIAAAAQASC8vIoVOABQiP7ysgdYooS42CRgybbgiZSkmBOyAQ9wYWlkY29udGVudC5vcme6AQo3Mjh4OTBfeG1syAEC2gEhaHR0cDovL3BhaWRjb250ZW50Lm9yZy9yc3MvaW5kZXgvwAIC4AIA6gINcGNfcnNzXzcyOHg5MPgC8tEekAPoApgD8AGoAwHQBJBO4AQBoAYU&amp;num=0&amp;sig=AOD64_1_68PJfqDdAqve6i5qVQD1ivagiA&amp;client=ca-pub-5615940046922652&amp;adurl=https://twitter.com/paidContent\"><img height=\"90\" src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imgad?id=CICAgICQrpvPThDYBRhaMgiU7zmYGvQ1wQ\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"728\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/lHVdxRKcdVVGGDquPFaXKam8rmM/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/lHVdxRKcdVVGGDquPFaXKam8rmM/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/lHVdxRKcdVVGGDquPFaXKam8rmM/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/lHVdxRKcdVVGGDquPFaXKam8rmM/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=1VlkNvdHVkM:Ndbx2JUVsNg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=1VlkNvdHVkM:Ndbx2JUVsNg:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=1VlkNvdHVkM:Ndbx2JUVsNg:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?i=1VlkNvdHVkM:Ndbx2JUVsNg:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=1VlkNvdHVkM:Ndbx2JUVsNg:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=1VlkNvdHVkM:Ndbx2JUVsNg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pcorg/~4/1VlkNvdHVkM\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 144212, "title": "Highlights Of 2011: A Year Of Tech And Publishing Lawsuits, By The Numbers"}, {"url": "http://blogs.computerworld.com/19470 at http://blogs.computerworld.com", "updated": "2011-12-22T11:00:06", "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://blogs.computerworld.com/19470/microsoft_and_ces_mutual_backstabbing\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"Steve Ballmer (Der Tommy @ Picasaweb) \" border=\"0\" height=\"100\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"http://blogs.computerworld.com/sites/default/themes/cw_blogs/cache/files/u34/ballmer.jpg\" title=\"Steve Ballmer (Der Tommy @ Picasaweb) \" vspace=\"7\" width=\"107\" /></a>Microsoft (NADSAQ:MSFT) says it's pulled out of CES 2013.

Today we have the latest chapter in that story: those who are on the social network <em>outside</em> the U.S.&#8212;more than 500 million people, by one estimate&#8212;will soon see a series of changes aimed at helping them control their presence on the site a little better.\n</p><p>The news comes on the heels of a <a href=\"http://moconews.net/article/419-ftc-announces-20-year-privacy-deal-with-facebook-asks-to-be-liked/\" title=\"landmark settlement between Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission\">landmark settlement between Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission</a> in the U.S., in which Facebook has agreed to a series of changes and modifications to improve how it handles privacy for its users in North America.</p>\n\n<p>The changes announced today for international Facebookers are the result of a three-month investigation by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland, where Facebook&#8217;s international operation is headquartered, looking at how Facebook complies with Irish data protection laws and, by extension, European data protection laws. </p>\n\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s Dublin office oversees accounts for all of Facebook&#8217;s users outside of the U.S. and Canada; these international users account for more than half of the 800 million people using the social network.</p>\n\n<p>In what the data protection commissioner <a href=\"http://dataprotection.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=1175&amp;m=f\" title=\"described\">described</a> as a &#8220;challenging engagement&#8221; for both sides&#8212;the most detailed investigation ever undertaken by the data protection office, in fact&#8212;Facebook has agreed to a series of changes to how it presents data and services to its users. It will start to implement those changes from now and will have a formal review of how it has complied in July 2012.<br />\n <br />\nMany have cited Facebook&#8217;s rapid growth, both in terms of users and services, as part of the reason for why the company has perhaps not been as mindful of privacy as it could have been. Reading through the summary of the Irish report, that seems to have been at least partly used as a reason for why some of these privacy missteps went ahead in the first place. The report refers to a &#8220;Darwinian&#8221; nature for different services on the site&#8212;except that in this case we can see that the hand of god (or, as the case may be, a regulator) can sometimes come into play to direct just how Facebook evolves.<br />\n&nbsp; <br />\nHere&#8217;s a rundown of the basic areas where Facebook will be making changes in the months ahead.

January has always been kind of a weird time to make a splash in the PC and consumer electronics markets, coming just after the shopping frenzy that tends to accompany the holiday season in the developed world.</p>\n\n<p>Apple (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=AAPL\" title=\"AAPL\">NSDQ: AAPL</a>) dropped its support for Macworld for similar reasons, although the declining health of the late Steve Jobs also pushed its hand to some extent. The sad truth about massive trade shows like CES is that fewer and fewer companies use the events to make big product introductions because it is exceedingly difficult to stand out from the pack: dozens of companies are holding press conferences over the first few days of the conference, and all are competing for attention from a small army of bloggers and journalists desperate for content.</p>\n\n<p>There is still a need for industry-wide gatherings that bring people together to network and cut deals, so it&#8217;s hard to see CES fading away too quickly. But like Apple, Microsoft seems to want to do more of its own events, where it can control the timing and presentation of its messages far more tightly than in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n<p>And in perhaps a fitting move, <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/21/microsofts-ces-2012-keynote-wont-deliver-significant-news-m/\" title=\"Engadget reports\">Engadget reports</a> that Microsoft is lowering news expectations for Ballmer&#8217;s final keynote by promising more of a &#8220;wrap-up&#8221; of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Updated: Maybe the Consumer Electronics Association didn&#8217;t want Ballmer hogging the spotlight anymore. In an interview with <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/21/consumer-electronics-show-loses-its-anchor-microsoft/\" title=\"The New York Times\">The New York Times</a>, the CEA said that it was the one that invited tech companies to keynote CES, rather than tech companies deciding whether or not they&#8217;d like to participate. Jason Oxman of the CEA said the decision was mutual and that there was no bad blood between the two organizations, but you have to wonder who made the first move.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=B0QkIqJTzTrCCLLKIgALq1uiNC7rLxcQCAAAAEAEgvLyKFTgAUIj-8rIHWKKEuNgkYMm24ImUpJgTsgEPcGFpZGNvbnRlbnQub3JnugEKNzI4eDkwX3htbMgBAtoBIWh0dHA6Ly9wYWlkY29udGVudC5vcmcvcnNzL2luZGV4L8ACAuACAOoCDXBjX3Jzc183Mjh4OTD4AvLRHpAD6AKYA_ABqAMB0ASQTuAEAaAGFA&amp;num=0&amp;sig=AOD64_15kgwOiM0FiOnAFMBWMUcjOv-MEw&amp;client=ca-pub-5615940046922652&amp;adurl=https://twitter.com/paidContent\"><img height=\"90\" src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imgad?id=CICAgICQrpvPThDYBRhaMgiU7zmYGvQ1wQ\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"728\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6K_kGHmFdFqK_Xs_cpApRzwmKdY/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6K_kGHmFdFqK_Xs_cpApRzwmKdY/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6K_kGHmFdFqK_Xs_cpApRzwmKdY/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/6K_kGHmFdFqK_Xs_cpApRzwmKdY/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=ctrAjKKBL-8:ikKdz6j4aTI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=ctrAjKKBL-8:ikKdz6j4aTI:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=ctrAjKKBL-8:ikKdz6j4aTI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?i=ctrAjKKBL-8:ikKdz6j4aTI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=ctrAjKKBL-8:ikKdz6j4aTI:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=ctrAjKKBL-8:ikKdz6j4aTI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pcorg/~4/ctrAjKKBL-8\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 144190, "title": "Updated: Microsoft Cashes Out Of Vegas: 2012 Its Last CES Keynote Speech"}, {"url": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/12/can-depression-be-diagnosed-with-a-picture-of-mother/", "updated": "2011-12-21T20:30:00", "summary": "When attempting to diagnose depression, it turns out that we don't need to ask people lots of questions or measure stress levels or investigate their mood.

Such was the case following yet another ruling Tuesday from the International Trade Commission involving mobile patents, this time with Microsoft (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=MSFT\" title=\"MSFT\">NSDQ: MSFT</a>) and Motorola (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=MMI\" title=\"MMI\">NYSE: MMI</a>) on opposite sides of the room.\n</p><p>Microsoft struck first following <a href=\"http://www.usitc.gov/press_room/documents/337_744_ID.pdf\" title=\"the ITC's ruling\">the ITC&#8217;s ruling</a>, which is always a good strategy. &#8220;ITC finds Motorola #patent infringment (sic) in #Microsoft case.

HTC immediately pledged to release a workaround for that patent.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;s not clear if Motorola will be able to do something similar should it not manage to prevail in subsequent rulings or on appeal, although the company said in a statement that believes the initial ruling will clarify the definition of the one patent on which it was said to infringe.</p>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Related</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"related\">\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-us-trade-body-agrees-to-apple-request-to-ban-certain-htc-phones/\" title=\"Updated: U.S. Trade Body Grants Apple Partial Ban For HTC Phones\">Updated: U.S. Trade Body Grants Apple Partial Ban For HTC Phones</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-one-more-step-in-the-googlemotorola-merger-eu-approval-sought/\" title=\"One More Step In The Google/Motorola Merger: EU Approval Sought\">One More Step In The Google/Motorola Merger: EU Approval Sought</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-google-to-support-android-oems-facing-lawsuits-as-lg-makes-a-deal-with-/\" title=\"Google To 'Support' Android OEMs Facing Lawsuits As LG Makes A Deal With IV\">Google To 'Support' Android OEMs Facing Lawsuits As LG Makes A Deal With IV</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-does-apple-ceo-tim-cook-also-want-to-destroy-android/\" title=\"Does Apple CEO Tim Cook Also Want To Destroy Android?\">Does Apple CEO Tim Cook Also Want To Destroy Android?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-intellectual-ventures-piles-on-motorolas-patent-woes-with-another-lawsu/\" title=\"Intellectual Ventures Piles On Motorola's Patent Woes With Another Lawsuit\">Intellectual Ventures Piles On Motorola's Patent Woes With Another Lawsuit</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-more-detail-or-guesswork-on-microsofts-patent-payout-444-millionyear/\" title=\"More Detail (Or Guesswork) On Microsoft's Patent Payout: $444 Million/Year\">More Detail (Or Guesswork) On Microsoft's Patent Payout: $444 Million/Year</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=BQqMIj47yTqboIfCBgAKIiLULusvFxAIAAAAQASC8vIoVOABQiP7ysgdYooS42CRgybbgiZSkmBOyAQ9wYWlkY29udGVudC5vcme6AQo3Mjh4OTBfeG1syAEC2gEhaHR0cDovL3BhaWRjb250ZW50Lm9yZy9yc3MvaW5kZXgvwAIC4AIA6gINcGNfcnNzXzcyOHg5MPgC8tEekAPoApgD8AGoAwHQBJBO4AQBoAYU&amp;num=0&amp;sig=AOD64_2Im3e3ewQyloHxTe-SURNL1ALiZQ&amp;client=ca-pub-5615940046922652&amp;adurl=https://twitter.com/paidContent\"><img height=\"90\" src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imgad?id=CICAgICQrpvPThDYBRhaMgiU7zmYGvQ1wQ\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"728\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HXQ9SipUxj7STOS5pUi341-UgmI/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HXQ9SipUxj7STOS5pUi341-UgmI/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HXQ9SipUxj7STOS5pUi341-UgmI/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HXQ9SipUxj7STOS5pUi341-UgmI/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=CJNLf5Akj9s:h37BpaY0qcA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=CJNLf5Akj9s:h37BpaY0qcA:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=CJNLf5Akj9s:h37BpaY0qcA:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?i=CJNLf5Akj9s:h37BpaY0qcA:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=CJNLf5Akj9s:h37BpaY0qcA:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=CJNLf5Akj9s:h37BpaY0qcA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pcorg/~4/CJNLf5Akj9s\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 145157, "title": "Both Sides Claim Victory In Microsoft-Motorola Patent Dispute At ITC"}, {"url": "http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/12/why-is-a-pelican-like-a-whale/", "updated": "2011-12-20T19:00:00", "summary": "How deep do the resemblances of pelican and whale mouths go?

Real time discovery. Real time search. Real time serendipity. The explosion of interest in social sharing tools like <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"http://www.friendfeed.com/\">FriendFeed</a> (remember this was early 2009) had people <a href=\"http://blog.louisgray.com/2008/12/10-predictions-for-2009-in-world-of.html\">(myself included</a>) saying that \u201cDelayed news will no longer be acceptable for early adopters, who will gravitate to the quickest sources of news, wherever they may be.\u201d In practice, while this has occasionally been true, I\u2019ve found a completely divergent innovation to play as big a role in the way I (and others) consume news content and entertainment - that of time shifting, which has remained valuable at a time when <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/collecta-shuts-down-its-real-time-search-engine-80354\">most real-time search engines</a> <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/walmart-buys-oneriot-for-walmartlabs-92740\">have pivoted or vanished</a>.\n</p><p>Best exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.tivo.com/\">TiVo</a> and other DVRs, preceded by the creaky VCR, the act of consuming media at a time much after its initial airing is so commonplace that live viewings are so uncommon that friends often tiptoe around current storylines for top shows. In some social circles, only the most breaking drama series get the \u201cday it actually aired\u201d treatment - like <a href=\"http://www.amctv.com/shows/breaking-bad\">Breaking Bad</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do\">Dexter</a> or <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/site/homeland/home.sho\">Homeland</a>, while everything else goes to TiVo (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=TIVO\" title=\"TIVO\">NSDQ: TIVO</a>), to be consumed later. (Obviously, I saw the season finales for Dexter and Homeland last night)</p>\n\n<p>News, with some exceptions, can be similarly stored away for later viewing, be it through RSS readers or on your social network of choice. One must not be glued to the real time stream to make sure you don\u2019t miss anything. Instead, the RSS reader traps your own hand-picked links, ready for viewing when you get the opportunity, not necessarily tied to their time of posting.</p>\n\n<p>On the big screen, movies may bank on a massive opening weekend, but with consumers having so many options for entertainment sources, it\u2019s common to see people mention they\u2019ll \u201cwait for Netflix\u201d, which could be months or years away, content to save a few dollars while also getting the comfort of watching in their own home. And if you do find yourself suddenly interested in a show your friends have been seeing which has been out a few seasons, don\u2019t fret, as you can, in almost all cases, catch up - tapping into many options, be they <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/\">Netflix</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hulu.com/\">Hulu</a>, <a href=\"http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/\">Xfinity</a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.itunes.com/\">iTunes</a> or <a href=\"http://market.android.com/\">Android Market</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This fall, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/louisgray/status/125076965186224128\">I made it a personal mission to watch all of Mad Men</a>, after hearing people go on and on about its quality. I powered through it with many late-night Netflix (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=NFLX\" title=\"NFLX\">NSDQ: NFLX</a>) marathons. After finally ordering Showtime, I caught up on this season\u2019s Dexter on Xfinity, and then did the same for Homeland. If my wife misses her favorite shows, she can do the same, tapping into the various video repositories on the web, including the big three networks, typically slower to adapt to the innovation of the web.</p>\n\n<p>I watch my evening talk shows 3 to 5 in a row, from <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/\">Jon Stewart</a> to <a href=\"http://teamcoco.com/\">Conan</a>, fast forwarding through commercials and skipping uninteresting guests - efficiently getting the best and skipping the rest. It\u2019s almost the same approach I take to <a href=\"http://www.google.com/reader\">my RSS reader</a> or activity on the social networks, skimming, reading, clicking and leaving no prisoners. Even if I\u2019m not constantly connected, and I do a good job of getting close, I don\u2019t feel this sense of missing something.</p>\n\n<p>Realtime reactions to breaking news events, kicked off by an initial discovery, and then rattling around search engines and social media, can\u2019t be duplicated by time shifted content, but for most buckets of content, be they text, audio or video, the drive to be first and in the mix of the story as it is interpreted and curated, is not essential. Advents in information and content sharing over the last few years have instead made \u201con demand\u201d a reality, getting me what I want when I want it, not when someone else decides for me.</p>\n\n<p><em>This post originally published on <a href=\"http://blog.louisgray.com/2011/12/time-shifting-in-world-of-realtime.html\">LouisGray.com</a></em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Louis Gray is a Silicon Valley tech geek blogger and author of <a href=\"http://www.louisgray.com\">LouisGray.com</a>.

P&amp;G agreed to the ban even though it disclosed in the ad that the image was enhanced.</p>\n<p>The move is the latest in a series of baby steps that U.S. and international advertising regulators have taken to ban the use of <a class=\"hidden_link\" href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/blackboard/photoshop\">Photoshop</a> in advertising when it is misleading to consumers.</p>\n<p>The company's decision was described in <a href=\"http://www.nadreview.org/\">a ruling by the National Advertising Division</a>, the U.S. industry watchdog that imposes self-regulation on the advertising business. NAD is part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Its rulings are respected and followed by most advertisers because it enjoys a close relationship with the FTC, from which it has historically drawn some of its senior staff. Recalcitrant advertisers who refuse to withdraw or amend misleading ads are referred by the NAD to the FTC, which has the power to fine, sue or bring injunctions against companies.</p>\n<p>When asked whether this was a <em>de facto</em> ban on Photoshop, NAD director Andrea Levine told us:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"You can&rsquo;t use a photograph to demonstrate how a cosmetic will look after it is applied to a woman&rsquo;s face and then &ndash; in the mice type &ndash; have a disclosure that says &lsquo;okay, not really.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The ad in question was for CoverGirl NatureLuxe Mousse Mascara, which promised &ldquo;2X more volume&rdquo; on women's lashes. After reviewing the ad, P&amp;G agreed to yank it. (A different CoverGirl ad is shown here.) The NAD ruling said:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"&hellip; [P&amp;G] advised NAD it has permanently discontinued all of the challenged claims and the photograph in its advertisement. NAD was particularly troubled by the photograph of the model &ndash; which serves clearly to demonstrate (i.e., let consumers see for themselves) the length and volume they can achieve when they apply the advertised mascara to their eyelashes. This picture is accompanied by a disclosure that the model&rsquo;s eyelashes had been enhanced post production.\"</p>\n<p>In a footnote, the NAD said it was following the lead of its sister body in the U.K., the Advertising Standards Authority, which in July <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42749569/if-photoshop-is-banned-in-advertising-itll-be-julia-roberts-fault/\">banned cosmetics ads featuring Julia Roberts and Christy Turlington</a> because they used Photoshop. The NAD said:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"Advertising self-regulatory authorities recognize the need to avoid photoshopping in cosmetics advertisements where there is a clear exaggeration of potential product benefits.\"</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"... the picture of Ms. Roberts had been altered using post production techniques (in addition to professional styling, make-up, photography and the product&rsquo;s inherent covering and smoothing nature which are to be expected), exaggerating what consumers could expect to achieve through product use.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.asa.org.uk/ASA-action/Adjudications/2011/7/LOreal-%28UK%29-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_149632.aspx\">U.K. ruling</a> found the use of photo retouching misleading <em>per se</em>.<br /><br />In the U.S., the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42743159/new-ftc-rules-for-bloggers-and-celebrities-are-all-steve-garveys-fault/?tag=bnetdomain\">FTC has has also tightened rules to hold celebrities accountable</a> if they make claims in ads they know cannot be true.</p>\n<p>And in France, in 2009, 50 politicians asked for <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42743096/french-pols-want-fashion-police-to-ban-retouched-models-in-ads/?tag=bnetdomain\">health warnings to be imposed on fashion ads</a> if they showed

src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/people/Sergei%20Brin-470-75.jpg\" /><p>Who's got the most oppressive internet censorship in the world? If you answered USA! USA! USA! you've clearly been listening to Google. </p><p>Writing about the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and Protect-IP Act (PIPA), Google co-founder Sergey Brin <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/google-founder-rails-against-anti-piracy-bills-1048064\">expressed his disappointment</a> that \"the newest threat to free speech has come from none other but the United States\".</p><p>Brin \u2013 and pretty much every other tech exec \u2013 is worried that in the name of fighting piracy, SOPA and PIPA will have terrible consequences. The acts would \"give the US government and copyright holders extraordinary powers including the ability to hijack DNS and censor search results (and this is even without so much as a proper court trial),\" Brin says.</p><p>He's not the only high profile figure speaking out against SOPA and PIPA: other critics include Netscape founder Marc Andreessen, Twitter's Biz Stone, YouTube's Chad Hurley, Jimmy Wales from Wikipedia and Yahoo founder Jerry Yang.</p><p>Jimmy Wales is threatening particularly <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/wikipedia-threatens-blackout-over-anti-piracy-bill-1047486\">extreme action</a>: he's planning to blank every page on Wikipedia US as a kind of virtual sit-in. </p><p>Wales says that the tactic has already been tried in Italy and worked very well: \"A few months ago, the Italian Wikipedia community made a decision to blank all of Italian Wikipedia for a short period in order to protest a law which would infringe on their editorial independence. The Italian Parliament backed down immediately.\"</p><p> However, we can't help thinking that since Wikipedia started plastering Wales' and his colleagues' sad faces on every page, the prospect of a Wikipedia blackout might seem like quite a good idea.</p><h4>Unintended consequences</h4><p>Critics of SOPA aren't necessarily pro-piracy. Their concern is that SOPA and PIPA are bad laws with potentially disastrous consequences for legitimate websites. </p><p>For example, some readings of the legislation suggest that the whole of Wordpress.com could be blocked because of the actions of a single blogger. The legislation could be particularly bad news for social media sites where users upload videos, post links or contribute other kinds of content: as Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian said in a YouTube video, the legislation \"threatens not just our internet but our livelihoods.\"</p><p>While the tech industry argued about how best to fight piracy, US comedian Louis CK has been taking matters into his own hands. He's recorded, edited and published an HD recording of his latest show and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/louis-c-k-makes-fortune-with-internet-only-show-1048013\">made it available online</a> for the princely sum of $5 (about \u00a33).</p><p>In a message to would-be pirates, CK wrote: \"To those who might wish to 'torrent' this video: look, I don't really get the whole 'torrent' thing. I don't know enough about it to judge either way. But I'd just like you to consider this: I made this video extremely easy to use against well-informed advice. I was told that it would be easier to torrent the way I made it, but I chose to do it this way anyway, because I want it to be easy for people to watch and enjoy this video in any way they want without 'corporate' restrictions.\"</p><p>Did it work? The video turned up on The Pirate Bay almost immediately, but the busiest torrent is still fairly quiet: at the time of writing there are 520 seeders and 47 leechers, which is fairly small potatoes for a well-publicised release. Meanwhile Louis CK has sold more than 110,000 copies of the video, which means he's already made a profit of around $200,000 (\u00a3120,000). </p><p>The big question over Louis CK's experiment is whether the same approach would work for anybody else. CK is a fairly high-profile comedian with a lot of loyal fans, which means \u2013 like \"pay what you like\" MP3-floggers Radiohead \u2013 there's a fairly large built-in audience for his work. </p><p>It's definitely worked for CK, though: as he <a href=\"https://buy.louisck.net/statement\">says on his website</a> (language may offend): \"at this point I think we can safely say that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again.\"</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/9809/s/1b022bdb/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Week+in+Tech%3A+Fighting+piracy%2C+or+removing+freedom%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-of-tech%2Ffighting-piracy-or-removing-freedom-1048441%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Week+in+Tech%3A+Fighting+piracy%2C+or+removing+freedom%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fworld-of-tech%2Ffighting-piracy-or-removing-freedom-1048441%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/121587384788/u/49/f/9809/c/669/s/1b022bdb/kg/281/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/121587384788/u/49/f/9809/c/669/s/1b022bdb/kg/281/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/allnews/~4/jLRzHcApyBo\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 145058, "title": "Week in Tech: Fighting piracy, or removing freedom?"}, {"url": "http://blogs.computerworld.com/19437 at http://blogs.computerworld.com", "updated": "2011-12-16T11:00:06", "summary": "<p>The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) hearing by the House Judiciary Committee did not go well for those who fear it gives censorship power to big businesses.

Two possible reasons for the delay? A volume bug that caused Google to issue a software fix, and a spat with Verizon over whether or not the NFC chip needed for the Google Wallet mobile-payments system met Verizon&#8217;s security expectations that is really more about the competition between Google Wallet and Isis, a mobile payments consortium backed by Verizon.</p>\n\n<p><em>Corrected 12/15: The headline and body of this

src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/seesmic-470-100.jpg\" /><h3>Best free Android apps: 1-25</h3><p>OK, so the Android Market is more akin to Lidl or Asda than the iPhone's enormous, indulgent Selfridges-at-Christmas time approach, but the open source nature of Google's OS means there are plenty of apps for Android to be found.</p><p>Most of the good stuff on Android is free, thanks to the work of developers who do it for love alone. So here's our pick of the top free Android apps you should install.</p><p>And you can find more great apps at <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/top-140-best-android-apps-2011-693696\">Top 150 best Android apps</a>. Also why not check out our video of the top 10 free Android games?</p>brightcove : 971998862001<p><strong>1. Seesmic</strong></p><p>There are many Twitter apps on Android - and Twitter itself shook up the scene with the launch of its own-brand app recently - but we're sticking with <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.seesmic\">Seesmic</a>. Offering support for multiple accounts, a home page widget showing latest tweets and an incredibly slick and professional design, it's one of the finest examples of app development out there today.</p><p><img alt=\"Seesmic\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/seesmic-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>2. Facebook for Android</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.facebook.katana\">Facebook for Android</a> is lacking in features compared to Facebook itself, but a recent update added Inbox support to the Android app, finally allowing its users to communicate in almost real time. The app's fast and stable, with a simplicity that reminds you of the old days when using Facebook used to be bearable. </p><p><img alt=\"Facebook for android\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/facebook_for_android-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>3. ASTRO File Manager</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.metago.astro\">ASTRO</a> is nothing more than a Windows-style file explorer, but if you're into tinkering and directly installing Android APK files yourself, it's essential to stick something like this on your phone. It makes your phone feel like a computer, and makes you feel like you're in charge of it.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> ASTRO still exists as a free ad-supported app, but you'll have to pay for the full version without ads. Our new favourite file explorer app is listed below. </p><p><img alt=\"Astro file manager\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/astro-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>4. UK Jobs<br /></strong></p><p>Hey, times are hard and you've got to pay for your oppressive monthly mobile phone contract somehow. Offering a fully searchable database of current UK job vacancies, <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=org.onejob.android.activities\">UK Jobs</a>, which pulls in its data from independent employment site <a href=\"http://www.1job.co.uk/\">1job.co.uk</a> is, a slightly cumbersome but useful and non-governmental tool.</p><p><img alt=\"uk-jobs\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/uk-jobs-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>5. Hotmail</strong></p><p>Microsoft has teamed up with developer SEVEN to offer an official <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.hotmail.Z7\">Hotmail app for Android</a>, which gives users a simple, clean interface, push notification support and even lets you manage multiple Hotmail accounts from within the app. If your email needs haven't yet been assimilated by Google, it's a useful option. </p><p><img alt=\"Hotmail\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/hotmail-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>6. Google Sky Map</strong></p><p>A stunning app that renders Patrick Moore obsolete, by using your phone's orientation tools to give you an accurate representation of the stars and planets on your screen. Point your phone at the sky, then learn what constellations are visible and if that's a UFO or just Venus. <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.stardroid\">Google Sky Map</a> even works indoors, if you're not keen on getting cold. </p><p><img alt=\"Google sky map\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/google_sky_map-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>7. Layar</strong></p><p>The stunning augmented reality app <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.layar\">Layar</a> has recently gone commercial, adding an online shop that allows users to buy AR content such as travel guides, local house price apps and much more. But you're still able to use the numerous free Layers to pop data up over real-world locations, delivering a satisfying futuristic experience. </p><p><img alt=\"Layar\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/layar-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>8. Foursquare</strong></p><p>The social media darling <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.joelapenna.foursquared\">Foursquare</a> is represented in fine form on Android, with the Google app offering easy one-click check-ins, integrated Google Maps for a seamless Google-branded experience and home page shortcut options to all your favourite places. </p><p><img alt=\"Foursquare\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/foursquare_android-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>9. WordPress for Android</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=org.wordpress.android\">WordPress for Android</a> started out as independent creation wpToGo, before WordPress decided it liked it so much it bought it up - hiring the maker to develop it in-house. It's very feature-packed, with the latest version offering full integration with other apps, letting you spin content and send it directly to the app for easy updating. It could do with more image insertion tools, though.</p><p><img alt=\"WordPress for android\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/wordpress_android-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>10. Google Goggles </strong></p><p>A bit of a novelty, in that <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.unveil\">Google Goggles</a> lets you take photos and have Google analyse them and come back with a search results page for what it thinks you're looking at. However, the app's main use is as a QR code reader, which lets you scan barcodes for quick access to apps and whatever data people choose to embed in the odd little data squares.</p><p><img alt=\"Google goggles\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/google_goggles-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>11.</strong> <strong>Winamp</strong></p><p>Yes, the same <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.nullsoft.winamp\">Winamp</a> from a decade ago. It's had an Android app for some time, with recent updates adding support for iTunes, Mac syncing, plenty of music streaming options, new release lists and Shoutcast integration for radio support. It's a fine, free media player. </p><p><img alt=\"Winamp\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/winamp-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>12.</strong> <strong>Samsung ChatOn</strong></p><p>There are plenty of messaging tools on Android, but Samsung's beats many of them by offering multi-platform support - with clients even available for older Samsung non-smart feature phones. It could be the ideal way to keep in touch with an out of touch relative. More \"with it\" users will be able to use its drawing, image sharing and social networking features. </p><p><img alt=\"Samsung\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/samsung-chaton-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>13. Skyfire 3.0 </strong></p><p>The USP of the Skyfire browser is that it supports Flash content, popping up a little window when it detects an embedded YouTube video or something similar. The actual Flash business is handled by Skyfire's server, which does all the computery stuff, then sends the file to your handset. A bit clunky on slower Android phones, but it works like a dream on models with faster processors.Despite the arrival of Flash with Android 2.2, this is still relevant for those on phones and Android versions not able to support Adobe's Flash Player. </p><p><img alt=\"Skyfire\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/skyfire-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>14.</strong> <strong>BBC News</strong></p><p>While the BBC's Android iPlayer app is a bit on the disappointing side, the corporation's <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=bbc.mobile.news.uk\">BBC News app</a> is much more refined. There's a stylish grid-based front page, plus you're able to swipe from left to right to switch between stories in your chosen specialist category. A recent update also added a couple of Home screen widgets, too, plus the ability to submit your own news tips, as if the BBC was a small blog clamouring for content. </p><p><img alt=\"BBC news\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/bbc-news-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>15. RAC Traffic</strong></p><p>An official production of the motoring organisation, <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.skyfire.browser\">RAC Traffic</a> is dead simple - it guesstimates your location via the mobile signal, then pops up the current traffic alerts for your area. It's much better than having to listen to the radio for the odd update about arterial blockages.</p><p><img alt=\"RAC traffic\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/rac_traffic-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>16. Swype</strong></p><p>The odd line-drawing alternate keyboard Swype is a love-it or hate-it kind of thing, with the significant amount of re-learning required to make the most of it quite offputting to some users. Once you're familiar with the idea, though, it's genius - with advanced prediction options further speeding your line-typing. Swype is not available through the Android Market - the only way to install is is via a <a href=\"http://www.swypeinc.com/\">direct download from the maker</a>. </p><p><img alt=\"Swype\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/swype_android-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>17. Evernote</strong></p><p>After the Android version of Dropbox, the next best solution for keeping all your 'business' in one place is <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.evernote\">Evernote</a> - which lets you stash and sync all your text notes, voice memos and files on your phone and access them through a desktop computer.</p><p><img alt=\"Evernote\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/evernote-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>18.</strong> <strong>Flickr</strong></p><p>As well as supporting <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.flickr\">Flickr</a> uploading, this app also lets you capture photos from within the app and comes complete with a set of filters, so you can hipsterise your life with ease. It supports sharing with Twitter and Facebook as well, so your other, non-photo-nerd friends can enjoy the results of today's snapping session. </p><p><img alt=\"Flickr\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/flickr-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>19. Last.fm</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/portable-devices/last-fm-does-a-spotify-goes-premium-for-mobile-devices-926667\">subscription-based</a> thrills of <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=fm.last.android\">Last.fm</a> open up a world of music streaming on your mobile. You have to 'buy in' to the odd Last.fm way of organising things and suggesting new music, but if you're easily led and not restricted by bandwidth it's a superb tool.</p><p><img alt=\"tune in radio\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/tunein-radio-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>20. Google Maps Navigation </strong></p><p>An absolute must-get. As long as you have Android 1.6 or above, the latest update to <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps\">Google Maps</a> introduces turn-by-turn voice navigation, simultaneously devastating the satnav industry while boosting the in-car dashboard dock/charger accessory scene. Route calculations are done at the outset of your trip, minimising data transfer en route and keeping you on target even when the GPS signal drops. It's amazing, it works, and it's free. </p><p><img alt=\"Google maps navigation\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/google_maps_navigation-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>21. 3banana Notes/ Catch Notes<br /></strong></p><p>A simple note-taking tool that lets you sync those disjointed, late night thoughts you have together into one huge, incoherent database. If you have a Snaptic account you're able to sync the Android app with that too - or you can simply log in with your Google details for instant mobile jotting. Once written, notes may also be pinned to the home screen, creating a little post-it note-style reminder icon.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 3banana has undergone a name change and is now known as <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.threebanana.notes\">Catch Notes</a>.</p><p><img alt=\"3banana\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/3banana-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>22. gvSIG Mini Maps</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=es.prodevelop.gvsig.mini\">gvSIG Mini Maps</a> is an incredibly comprehensive mapping tool which combines major online maps including Google, Bing, Open Street Map and more, which will win UK fans for one huge reason alone - it supports the official and recently open-sourced Ordnance Survey data. This means you're never more than a post code search away from seeing where you are in OS-level detail, which offers much more in the way of accurate local data than other map tools provide. </p><p><img alt=\"gvsig\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/gvsig_android-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>23. Astrid Task / Todo list</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.timsu.astrid\">Astrid</a> describes itself as an \"open source\" task list, which includes syncing support with <a href=\"http://www.rememberthemilk.com\">www.rememberthemilk.com</a> for the ultimate in minutiae management. You set a list of tasks and are then able to order them according to their importance - also setting off a timer to see precisely how long you've wasted on Twitter instead of doing the job in hand. It's basically the world's most complex and in-depth personal to do list, which, if used correctly, will consume more time than the tasks themselves. Ideal for expert-level procrastinators.</p><p><img alt=\"astrid\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/astrid_todo_list-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>24. Shareprice </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.shareprice.app.android\">Shareprice</a> uses your login from financial site <a href=\"http://www.iii.co.uk\">www.iii.co.uk</a> to offer live share price updates on your Android phone. Watch your nest-egg lose 50 per cent in value every three weeks during the latest trans-global financial crisis, live! It's ideal for users with share values so low they have to be checked in private, to ensure their partner doesn't see exactly how much money has disappeared into some notional financial black hole. </p><p><img alt=\"shareprice\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/shareprice_uk-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>25. Skifta</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.skifta.android.app\">Skifta</a> is the first software tool to be granted DLNA certification, meaning it turns your Android phone into an official DLNA device. This in turn means streaming all of your household media to your phone, and beaming your phone videos to your TV. Seems a little buggy at the moment, but there are plenty of updates arriving all the time. Requires Android 2.2 or higher.</p><p><img alt=\"skifta\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/skifta-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><h3>Best free Android apps: 26-50</h3><p><strong>26. Dropbox</strong></p><p>The Android version of the insanely popular stuff-syncing app has arrived, and while <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.dropbox.android\">Dropbox</a> is a little lacking in the sort of fancy auto-syncing options many were hoping for, it still works as expected. Files have to be specifically downloaded to your phone to be edited or shared, which is not quite the automated dream offered by the desktop tools, but it's still Dropbox on Android. Six months ago that was a distant, crazy fantasy.</p><p><img alt=\"dropbox\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/dropbox-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>27. London Tube Status</strong></p><p>Reduce the misery of being told you've just missed a train and it's a 14-minute wait until the next one with <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=ptc.tflstatus\">London Tube Status</a>, which combines travel status updates and live departure times. It also includes a home screen widget that shows your favourite (or at least your most used) platform departures, making it easy to check how much you've just missed the next one by while tearing down the escalators. </p><p><img alt=\"London tube status\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/london_tube_status-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>28. Amazon UK </strong></p><p>Amazon recently launched an <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=uk.amazon.mShop.android\">official Android app</a>, replacing its reliance on a mobile web store. The app's very simple and fast to use, and even includes full shopping cart features with Amazon's one-click system once you've signed in with your usual account details. </p><p><img alt=\"amazon-uk\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/amazon-uk-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>29. Meebo IM</strong></p><p>If you like to pass the time exchanging smiley faces and abbreviations with your friends through instant messaging apps, you ought to get a copy of <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.meebo\">Meebo IM</a>. It's an instant messaging aggregator, incorporating AIM, MSN, Yahoo, MySpace, Facebook, good old ICQ and more, serving everything up in one convenient interface. Typing in all your logins and passwords for everything is the only, very temporary, inconvenience. </p><p><img alt=\"Meebo im\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/meebo_im-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>30. Beelicious</strong></p><p>If you're into the slightly last-generation social networking site Delicious, you ought to get yourself organised with one of the many third-party Android apps out there that support the bookmarking tool. Such as <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=net.bitquill.delicious\">Beelicious</a>, which, once you've got through the slightly cumbersome initial set-up process, lets you simply send website links to your Delicious account via the Android browser's 'Share Page' sub menu. </p><p><img alt=\"Beelicious\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/beelicious-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>31. TweetDeck</strong></p><p>The new star on the Twitter app scene, <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.thedeck.android.app\">TweetDeck for Android</a> is one amazing little tool. As well as presenting your timeline, DMs and replies in separate side-by-side panels that you swipe the screen to flip between, it can also pull in Facebook status updates. And mix it all in together. And it does Foursquare. And Buzz. </p><p><img alt=\"tweetdeck\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/tweetdeck-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>32. iPlayer</strong></p><p>The BBC's <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=bbc.iplayer.android\">iPlayer app</a> has finally arrived, and a right weird old mixed bag it is, too. On the one hand, support for streaming radio and live TV channels (Wi-Fi only) elevates this over the Android 2.2 compatible mobile website, but the requirement for Android 2.2 and Flash Player 10.1 remains. And there's no 3G streaming, not even of radio feeds. And you can't download shows, unlike in the sadly departed Beebplayer. And the radio requires the screen to be on at all times. Strange app, this. </p><p><img alt=\"iplayer\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/iplayer-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>33. Google Reader </strong></p><p>Google has brought its RSS feed tool into the app era, launching its <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.reader\">Google Reader for Android</a>. It's got some great functionality built in, with support for multiple Google accounts and plenty of thread customisation options. You're also able to use the volume rocker to page up and down between messages, which is handy for extra-lazy news assimilation. </p><p><img alt=\"Google reader\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/google_reader-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>34. BT FON</strong></p><p>BT's incredibly clever FON network is often a lifesaver, letting you legally borrow Wi-Fi for free in many public places. And while standing outside strangers' houses. The <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bt.mnie.wispr\">BT FON Android app</a> lets you automate the sign-in process, so you can walk around towns and housing estates safe in the knowledge that your phone's always seeking out available Wi-Fi. You need a BT FON username, though, so sort that out before you venture out into the scary internet-free world. </p><p><img alt=\"BT fon\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/BT-FON-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>35. Amazon Kindle</strong></p><p>Amazon's <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.amazon.kindle\">Kindle</a> app is a great e-reader, which is seamlessly linked with your Amazon account. Support for magazines and newspapers is limited at the moment, with only a handful of niche publications in Android-friendly format. But for books it's great, with plenty of screen and text display options to get it looking a way that hurts your eyes the least. Another exciting new way to collect classic novels you'll probably never get around to reading because there's the internet now.</p><p><img alt=\"Amazon kindle\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/amazon_kindle-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>36. ES File Explorer </strong></p><p>We're officially out-of-love with previous favourite file explorer ASTRO, thanks to it now coming plastered with ads. <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.estrongs.android.pop\">ES File Explorer</a> is prettier, ad-free, and comes with a much more user-friendly and functional interface. And yes, Android users have favourite file explorers. </p><p><img alt=\"ES file explorer\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/es-file-explorer-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>37. Androidify</strong></p><p>Let your hair down by creating a realistic interpretation of what you hair looks like with <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.androidify\">Androidify</a>. It's an avatar creator that uses the Android mascot as its base, letting you swap trousers and hats with the swipe of a finger. Results are then sharable via Twitter and the usual social tools. There aren't enough types of beard, though. Please release a Beard Expansion Pack. </p><p><img alt=\"Androidify\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/androidify-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>38. Kongregate Arcade</strong></p><p>Thanks to Android's Flash Player powers, casual gaming portal <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.kongregate.android.kongarcade\">Kongregate</a> is able to bring a huge number of its internet games to Android. They run in the browser so resolutions can be a bit all over the place, but with over 300 games to choose from there's bound to be something there for you. </p><p><img alt=\"Kongregate\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/kongregate-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>39. Blogger </strong></p><p>The Google-owned Blogger platform now has a presence in the current decade, thanks to the official <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.blogger\">Blogger app</a>. It's remarkably simple, supports image uploads and geo-tagging and imports the settings of all blogs associated with your Gmail account. There's no fancy editing the positions of your photos, which just get chucked in at the bottom, but it works. </p><p><img alt=\"Blogger\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/blogger-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>40. RD Mute</strong></p><div><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.raidroid.rdmute\">RD Mute</a> serves one purpose \u2013 to turn off all phone sounds when the Android accelerometer tells it you've picked it up and turned it over. It's a 'silent mode' shortcut for when you can't even be bothered to press a button. Put your phone on its front to shut it up \u2013 and add any very important numbers to the app's exceptions list, so people you don't mind talking to can get through.</div><p><img alt=\"RD mute\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/gadgets/phones/mobile-phones/Android/free-android-apps/rd-mute-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>41. OnLive </strong></p><p>The technically astounding streaming video gaming service has now arrived on Android, with an official <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.onlive.client\">OnLive</a> app letting Android users play console titles on their phones and tablets via wi-fi. It's best played on devices with big screens, but it'll still run on something as relatively modest as an HTC Desire. On-screen controls are the big trade-off, here - but it will work with OnLive's Bluetooth wireless controller, if you've seriously bought in to the OnLive dream.</p><p><img alt=\"OnLive\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/onlive-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>42. MailOnline</strong></p><p>Quite a few official news apps have launched on Android since we last updated this list. The Guardian has one, The Times has one, Channel 4 News has one and so does the country's guiltiest pleasure, the <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.dailymail.online\">MailOnline</a>. It features offline caching and lets users specify a time for it to sync pages with the main site, so you're in complete control of how and when you get your faux scandal.</p><p><img alt=\"MailOnline\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/mailonline-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>43. Sky+ </strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bskyb.android.skyplus\">Sky+</a> app has been on Android for quite some time, but it's recently been given a superb visual refresh and a new custom interface for those doing their telly research on an Android tablet. The feature set has been expanding, too, now including a nice Showcase front section, more programme details, plus, of course, the Remote Record features to set your Sky+ box recording through 3G or wi-fi. </p><p><img alt=\"Sky+\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/sky+-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>44. eBay</strong></p><p>Another app that's been out there for a while on Android, the <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ebay.mobile\">eBay</a> tool has also been updated so much that it's now a credible alternative to the desktop site. A recent update bought the ability to list items direct from the app, while there's a simple PIN system that makes paying for your winnings via PayPal much simpler and less convoluted than it is on the full blown web site. </p><p><img alt=\"eBay\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/ebay-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>45. LOVEFiLM By Post</strong></p><p>There's now an official Android <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.lovefilm.android\">LOVEFiLM app</a>, which lets you manage your account through your phone. You also get all the peripheral nonsense like reviews and trailers, but the key feature is the ability to manage your rental list, shuffling the order of your requests and filtering out categories you never trouble. </p><p><img alt=\"Lovefilm\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/lovefilm-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>46. Tesco Groceries</strong></p><p>This isn't an advert or a casual game featuring Jamie Oliver. <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.tesco.grocery.view\">Tesco Groceries</a> is a fully mobile home delivery shopping experience, covering everything from booking your delivery slot to amending orders already placed. It uses voice input for easily searching for items, plus there's barcode scanner support for identifying and ordering stuff direct from your cupboard. Makes buying toilet rolls fun. </p><p><img alt=\"Tesco\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/tesco-groceries-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>47. Path</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.path&#38;hl=en\">Path</a> is an alternate social network, designed to make sharing things with friends easier and more... personal. It does simple stuff like share your music listening history, then it does weird stuff like track how many hours you've slept for. It's also location aware, so if you'd like it to broadcast your every movement, that's possible. And if you can't pull yourself away from Facebook, stuff from here can be posted up there, too, although posts can also be locked so they never leave Path if you'd prefer.</p><p><img alt=\"Path\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/path-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>48. Sky Sports Live Football Score Centre</strong></p><p>The latest <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.bskyb.fbscore%20\">Sky Sports Live Football Score Centre</a> app from BSkyB is an entirely sports-related option, giving access to live scores, league tables, match stats and results, also incorporating the new Sky Sports News Radio service for listening in, live, to the blokes in the studio guffawing away about free kick decisions. </p><p><img alt=\"Sky sports\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/sky-sports-score-centre-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>49. Yelp</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=com.yelp.android\">Yelp</a> gives you a similar option to Google's wide range of social place reviews, only here you also get an augmented reality screen display, so you can point it at the skyline and see what five-star eating establishments are in the area. Places are backed up by user reviews, too, making it easy to get an up to date opinion on how generous a particular cafe is with the chips. </p><p><img alt=\"Yelp\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/yelp-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>50. Odeon Cinemas</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://market.android.com/details?id=uk.co.odeon.androidapp\">Odeon Android app</a> is impressive on a couple of levels. Being able to buy tickets through your phone is still quite an exciting thing to do, but this one goes further by including a graphical tool that lets you book your specific seats. Plus you get all the scheduled film showing times and the trailers you'd expect from something that's trying to encourage you to endure another by-the-numbers Hollywood product. </p><p><img alt=\"Odeon\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/Mobile%20Phones/Android/10-new-android-apps/odeon-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/9809/s/1af91001/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Updated%3A+50+best+free+Android+apps&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fphone-and-communications%2Fmobile-phones%2F50-best-free-android-apps-687252%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Updated%3A+50+best+free+Android+apps&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fphone-and-communications%2Fmobile-phones%2F50-best-free-android-apps-687252%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/121221441156/u/49/f/9809/c/669/s/1af91001/kg/273-281-295-300/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/121221441156/u/49/f/9809/c/669/s/1af91001/kg/273-281-295-300/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/allnews/~4/ebPSXWZCyUU\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 149007, "title": "Updated: 50 best free Android apps"}, {"url": "http://blogs.computerworld.com/19430 at http://blogs.computerworld.com", "updated": "2011-12-15T11:00:06", "summary": "<p><a href=\"http://blogs.computerworld.com/19430/carrier_iq_humbled_grilled_by_feds\"><img align=\"right\" alt=\"Carrier IQ logo \" border=\"0\" height=\"45\" hspace=\"0\" src=\"http://blogs.computerworld.com/sites/default/themes/cw_blogs/cache/files/u34/carrier-iq.jpg\" vspace=\"7\" width=\"214\" /></a>Carrier IQ has been interviewed by the FCC and FTC in the ongoing row over smartphone privacy (or lack of it).

But so far, the popular funnyman seems to be having more success with his experiment than the English band did. CK offers the details in a public letter laced with insight (and profanity).\n</p><p>CK&#8217;s gambit was to record an expensive New York production and then to sell recordings of it via his website. He upped the ante by selling the videos for only $5 and letting people play it however and where ever they chose. With a season&#8217;s worth of his best jokes at stake, the comedian said the experiment was like a farmer betting his annual crop.</p>\n\n<p>The bet seems to have paid off. CK reports that he has already grossed $500,000 in four days and hopes that people will keep paying so that he can make &#8220;sh*tloads of money.&#8221; He also says the scheme will produce a greater profit than what he would have made by turning over the production to an outside licensing company that charged users $20 a pop.</p>\n\n<p>The actual numbers listed in CK&#8217;s letter go like this. Costs: $170,000 to produce and direct the video himself + $32,000 for a high quality website + unstated cost to rent &#8220;elite&#8221; Manhattan theater venue. Revenues: $500,000 from over 110,000 downloads minus PayPal processing fees + ticket sales from two shows at said elite venue.</p>\n\n<p>The bottom line: $200,000 in profit (I&#8217;m not quite sure how CK gets to this number but that&#8217;s what he states in his letter).</p>\n\n<p>The comedian&#8217;s account is interesting in itself but more so for what it might mean for other creative types. Has he hit a pricing sweet spot? Recall that Radiohead&#8217;s pay-what-you-want scheme for its 2007 &#8220;In Rainbow&#8221; album was hardly a smashing success after &#8220;what-you-want&#8221; for most people turned out to be exactly zero. According to <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/11/06/radiohead-download.html\" title=\"reports\">reports</a>, most people paid nothing at all for the popular album while those who did paid around $6.</p>\n\n<p>But if pay-what-you-want isn&#8217;t a viable option, asking $20 for a digital performance is also likely to leave many consumers willing to forgo the purchase altogether or acquire it through other means.</p>\n\n<p>With his $5 pricing point, CK may have found the right middle ground&#8212;a price that is higher than nothing but low enough to attract a mass volume. And what of the decision to impose no rights restrictions on the video? For now, it seems to have produced an outcome that is at least revenue-neutral. This may because the video is easy to swap but, at the same time, the price is so low that many will opt for the convenience of simply buying their own copy.</p>\n\n<p>Louis CK&#8217;s account can be found <a href=\"https://buy.louisck.net/statement\" title=\"here\">here</a> on his website.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=Bv43jYSfrTr_zHO6JgAKLgvWXC7rLxcQCAAAAEAEgvLyKFTgAUIj-8rIHWKKEuNgkYMm24ImUpJgTsgEPcGFpZGNvbnRlbnQub3JnugEKNzI4eDkwX3htbMgBAtoBIWh0dHA6Ly9wYWlkY29udGVudC5vcmcvcnNzL2luZGV4L8ACAuACAOoCDXBjX3Jzc183Mjh4OTD4AvLRHpAD6AKYA_ABqAMB0ASQTuAEAaAGFA&amp;num=0&amp;sig=AOD64_3rLVNl5e2vA6x7EqwrBokZNG25mg&amp;client=ca-pub-5615940046922652&amp;adurl=https://twitter.com/paidContent\"><img height=\"90\" src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imgad?id=CICAgICQrpvPThDYBRhaMgiU7zmYGvQ1wQ\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"728\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HW3aaR3V-mFtjHHFagmt1A0XdYU/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HW3aaR3V-mFtjHHFagmt1A0XdYU/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HW3aaR3V-mFtjHHFagmt1A0XdYU/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/HW3aaR3V-mFtjHHFagmt1A0XdYU/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=W2DNU0u13e0:VHz6EB91j5s:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=W2DNU0u13e0:VHz6EB91j5s:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=W2DNU0u13e0:VHz6EB91j5s:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?i=W2DNU0u13e0:VHz6EB91j5s:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=W2DNU0u13e0:VHz6EB91j5s:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=W2DNU0u13e0:VHz6EB91j5s:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pcorg/~4/W2DNU0u13e0\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 146001, "title": "Comedian Louis CK Says $5 Rights-Free Content Is A Winner"}, {"url": "tag:contentnext.com,2011-12-14:article/419-say-media-acquires-readwriteweb-hires-dan-frommer-as-editor-at-large", "updated": "2011-12-15T01:57:20", "summary": "<p style=\"border: 1px solid silver; padding: 4px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 0; float: left;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"image_link image\" href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-say-media-acquires-readwriteweb-hires-dan-frommer-as-editor-at-large/\" id=\"199579_12130\" title=\"Say Media Readwriteweb\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img alt=\"Say Media Readwriteweb\" border=\"0\" height=\"150\" src=\"http://paidcontent.org/images/editorial/_original/say-media-readwriteweb-o.jpg\" style=\"margin: 0;\" width=\"150\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>SAY Media, which in recent months has acquired Remodelista and <a href=\"http://paidcontent.org/article/419-say-media-acquires-dogster-to-build-out-lifestyle-more-deals-coming-soo/\" title=\"Dogster\">Dogster</a> and launched Jane Pratt&#8217;s xoJane.com, is expanding into the tech space with its acquisition of ReadWriteWeb.

It\u2019s great if you already know what you\u2019re looking for, but if you\u2019re hoping for the well-curated serendipity of a bookstore to lead you to something unique and unexpected, Amazon (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=AMZN\" title=\"AMZN\">NSDQ: AMZN</a>) recommendations often fall flat. It\u2019s because \u201cpeople who bought this item also bought\u2026\u201d is too impersonal, too list-based, and simply leads to the most popular books in a category.</p>\n\n<p>In an attempt to fill this discovery gap, Rhomberg has founded <a href=\"http://www.jellybooks.com\" title=\"Jellybooks\">Jellybooks</a>, a book discovery and sharing tool that will also offer Groupon-type book deals to its users.\n</p><p>According to Rhomberg, \u201cWe use similar principles as those employed by last.fm to make it easier to find great, but possibly obscure books. Our goal is to break the tyranny of the bestseller list. There are truly great books that appear on no bestseller list.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Set to launch in early spring, the Jellybooks experience corrects some common mistakes in online book browsing, says Rhomberg: \u201cWe have spent many months trying to understand why physical bookshops still play such an important role in discovery.\u201d For example, people really do use book covers in deciding what to read, so you won\u2019t see thumbnail reductions. Interestingly (but very right when you think about it), cost isn\u2019t much of a factor in choosing a book: \u201cWe found that price information plays very, very little role when users try to decide what makes for a great read. Clearly it matters when they have decided to buy a book at which point they will shop around (i.e. buy online and not in a physical store), but during the discovery process, price information is not a factor, so lets get rid of it.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Once a user finds a book that looks interesting, they can download the first 10% to a personal cloud library account to read later on a device of their choice. These samples will be available two to six weeks before the title appears in stores. There\u2019s no DRM, and they can be shared with a link without restriction. Rhomberg envisions this as a useful tool for recommending books to friends via email and social networks, but also for bloggers, authors, and journalists: \u201cThink of how video clips are shared by posting a YouTube (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=GOOG\" title=\"GOOG\">NSDQ: GOOG</a>) link and now imagine the same for e-books.\u201d At the end of the excerpt is a link allowing the reader to buy the book at their store of choice.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, the reader is buying directly from an online retailer, not Jellybooks. Some retailers might pay a small referral fee, but Rhomberg says that \u201cis not materially significant to the model.\u201d No, what Jellybooks gets out of the discovery process is information: \u201cOur discovery service is designed to shed light on what readers sample, what they share, and how they are influenced. The concept of sharable links allows us to measure how recommendations spread between readers and measure specific influence.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve started browsing, downloading, and sharing, Jellybooks will use the information it has gathered to offer you special 50-percent off \u201cSweet Deals\u201d on books that fit well with your choices so far. Not every Jellybooks user will be notified about every sale. \u201cBooks are quite personal and you don\u2019t want people to get the wrong perception that they\u2019re getting irrelevant stuff or too much stuff. So your reading and sharing behavior allows us to determine if you would be interested in getting the deal.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Similar to Groupon (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=GRPN\" title=\"GRPN\">NSDQ: GRPN</a>), the deal only happens if enough people sign on to purchase, which means sharing is important for attaining the required number. If it\u2019s reached within the 12-hour span, the book is downloaded (Sweet Deals are currently e-books only) and your credit card is charged. One important difference from Groupon, Rhomberg notes, is that \u201cthe discount has to be earned by the group as a whole. With Groupon it often just automatically goes over. Here we don\u2019t want you to feel it\u2019s too automatic and so you\u2019re lazy\u2026In its nuances it\u2019s constructed to be a little more social and a little bit more about recommendations.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Publishers nominate books to be Sweet Deals, and, if selected, stipulate the number that must be sold for the deal to take place. The deals can be used to give a book a second wind six to nine months after publication, to promote a previous title when an author has a new publication, to expose readers to a first book in a series, or to sell bundles of backlist books. So far, \u201cpublishers\u2019 reception has been very, very positive, because discoverability is an issue of enormous importance to them and their authors.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Jellybooks will initially launch in the UK, but plans are in place \u201cto be live in over dozens more countries supporting e-books in multiple languages by the end of 2012.\u201d</p>\n\n<p><em>This story originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.publishingperspectives.com\" title=\"Publishing Perspectives\">Publishing Perspectives</a>, a website of global publishing news and opinion.</p>\n\n<p>The author is Amanda DeMarco, a contributing editor for Publishing Perspectives.

The receiver will be empowered to hold an auction to sell off the copyrights that appear to be Righthaven&#8217;s only assets.</p>\n\n<p>For those unfamiliar with Righthaven, the self-styled copyright enforcer created a stir in 2010 when it partnered with two western newspaper chains to sue people who posted news stories on their blogs. The firm was for a time earning hundreds of thousands of dollars through coercive settlement offers. But the wheels began to come off this year when a judge halted the lawsuits and one of Righthaven&#8217;s two partners walked away, denouncing the scheme as a &#8220;dumb idea.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>In the last two months, the company has been on the ropes as bloggers have counter-sued and won decisions saying they were protected by fair use and that Righthaven must pay penalties and attorneys&#8217; fees. The most prominent of these has been the Hoehn case which has left the company scrambling to protect its assets before Hoehn&#8217;s lawyers can find and sell them.</p>\n\n<p>The assets in question are the newspapers&#8217; copyrights. Righthaven needs these if it has any hope of persuading an appeals court that it has fixed the original problem that led a court to halt the lawsuits in the first place. In a nutshell, that court said Righthaven couldn&#8217;t sue because it didn&#8217;t own the copyright and now Righthaven is telling the appeals court , &#8220;Wait, we do own the copyright now. Please confirm this so that we can continue our lawsuits and raise some money.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The new order authorizing the auction means that Righthaven is in a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don&#8217;t position. If it produces the copyrights, they will be sold and its case in the appeals court would fall apart.

Universal and others have responded by yanking the video from YouTube (<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"http://finance.paidcontent.org/paidcontent?Page=QUOTE&amp;Ticker=GOOG\" title=\"GOOG\">NSDQ: GOOG</a>) for copyright reasons&#8212;and now Megaupload is suing to get a restraining order and a declaration that it has rights to the video.\n</p><p>The lawsuit makes good on Megaload&#8217;s threat yesterday that it would go to court to stop a barrage of take-down notices that have forced YouTube and others to purge the popular video.</p>\n\n<p>Fans of the sharing service are enraged that Universal is pulling the plug on the video even though the footage shows its artists, including Macy Gray and will.i.am, appearing to endorse Megaload. The video has for now disappeared from various websites but the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/dec/13/megaupload-universal-youtube-video?newsfeed=true\" title=\"Guardian reports\">Guardian reports</a> that it includes clips like Gray singing &#8220;M-E-G-A. Upload to me today!&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit also names a hundred &#8220;John Does&#8221; who are people responsible for removing the video that Megaload can&#8217;t yet identify. The company might have a problem, though, because one of the John Does ordering the video taken down appears to be will.i.am himself.</p>\n\n<p>As the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/william-megaupload-kim-kardashian-p-diddy-272414\" title=\"Hollywood Reporter notes\">Hollywood Reporter notes</a>, Megaupload may have pulled a fast one by obtaining the short clips from the celebrities without informing them about the nature of the video.</p>\n\n<p>It will be interesting to see what a court thinks about this one. If Megaload has indeed cleared the rights for the clips, Universal will have a hard time justifying its use of copyright to pull down the videos. The celebrities, however, could claim the video is a false endorsement although Megaload claims in its suit that it obtained a release to use their images.</p>\n\n<p>The Hong Kong based service is asking for an order as well as damages based on <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/IP\" title=\"a law \">a law </a>that lets people sue over false copyright claims.</p>\n\n<font size=\"2\"><a href=\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/108373347/Megaload-claim-against-Universal-and-John-Does\">Megaload claim against Universal and John Does</a></font><br />&#8220;&#8221;&#8220;&#8221;&#8220;&#8221;\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=B22u3CZ7oTu2WD8uUqwGN7p2iC7rLxcQCAAAAEAEgvLyKFTgAUIj-8rIHWKKEuNgkYMm24ImUpJgTsgEPcGFpZGNvbnRlbnQub3JnugEKNzI4eDkwX3htbMgBAtoBIWh0dHA6Ly9wYWlkY29udGVudC5vcmcvcnNzL2luZGV4L8ACAuACAOoCDXBjX3Jzc183Mjh4OTD4AvLRHpAD6AKYA_ABqAMB0ASQTuAEAaAGFA&amp;num=0&amp;sig=AOD64_07cCjpaYXtTGv3u8mopM3r3qP__g&amp;client=ca-pub-5615940046922652&amp;adurl=https://twitter.com/paidContent\"><img height=\"90\" src=\"http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/imgad?id=CICAgICQrpvPThDYBRhaMgiU7zmYGvQ1wQ\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"728\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/arNE0ytyhUszCGoaXLHjx6FCzDM/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/arNE0ytyhUszCGoaXLHjx6FCzDM/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/arNE0ytyhUszCGoaXLHjx6FCzDM/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/arNE0ytyhUszCGoaXLHjx6FCzDM/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=7ohe2Qx8Q7A:NtPYTguPC64:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=7ohe2Qx8Q7A:NtPYTguPC64:dnMXMwOfBR0\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=7ohe2Qx8Q7A:NtPYTguPC64:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?i=7ohe2Qx8Q7A:NtPYTguPC64:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=7ohe2Qx8Q7A:NtPYTguPC64:7Q72WNTAKBA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=7Q72WNTAKBA\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.paidcontent.org/~ff/pcorg?a=7ohe2Qx8Q7A:NtPYTguPC64:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/pcorg?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pcorg/~4/7ohe2Qx8Q7A\" width=\"1\" />", "id": 41156, "title": "Megaupload Sues Universal For Pulling Down Celebrity Endorsement Video"}, {"url": "https://www.infoworld.com/homepage/181571 at https://www.infoworld.com", "updated": "2011-12-13T11:00:00", "summary": "<div style=\"padding: 8px;
